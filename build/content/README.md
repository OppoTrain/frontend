Our story

I am from Palestine. At work, I had an opportunity to train university students. In 2023, I trained 5 engineers from various backgrounds and they discussed the same local student’s problem in struggling in finding fit internships. In our quest to assist students in their career journeys, we aim to create a chatbot community. By leveraging technology, we hope to bridge the gap between students and suitable internships. Our goal is to equip students with the essential skills and sources required to secure these opportunities.
